  <h3><span>Hi I am mavelii or mahabali.In the past years I was known to be a great king or like something big.But nowadays my people are after bahubali and other film stars who fight like warriors.People celebrate onam for posting reels in instagram or youtube.Kerala during Onam is marked by happiness, excitement and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is celebrated as an outcome of reasons that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarian practices. If one is to go by the myth, then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and virtuous ruler, who had once ruled Kerala.  Onam marks the beginning of the annual harvest season in the southern parts of India. It is celebrated with great enthusiasm and accompanied by multiple festivities throughout Kerala and is treated as the official state festival. As per the Malayalam calendar, the festival is celebrated in the first month of Chingam, which overlaps with August-September in the Gregorian calendar.Although Onam is a significant festival for Malayali Hindus, all communities in Kerala celebrate this festival with great zeal. The celebrations of Onam go on for 10 days and include multiple colourful events, starting with Atthachamayam featuring a street parade with folk songs and dance, carnival floats and decorated elephants walking down the roads. Other festivities include Pookalam (flower arrangement), Pulikali (masked tiger dance), Vallamkali (snake boat race) and other traditional arts and games. Onam Sadya, a nine-course traditional feast, is prepared on the 11th day to honour the return of the king and the next day, the clay pyramids representing the king called Onathappan are immersed in water and the pookalams are wiped out.</span></h3>
